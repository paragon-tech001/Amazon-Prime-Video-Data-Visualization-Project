In the era of digital streaming, platforms like Amazon Prime Video have revolutionized the way we consume media. This project aims to analyze and visualize the Amazon Prime Video dataset to uncover key trends and insights about the content available on the platform. Using data from Kaggle and leveraging Tableau for visualizations, we focus on various key performance indicators (KPIs) to understand the distribution and popularity of shows and movies on Amazon Prime Video.
